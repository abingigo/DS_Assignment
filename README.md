Assignment for Discrete Structures.

There are two programs in this repository.

One calculates the probability of n people having the same birthday and works in the Python3 IDE of JDoodle.
The other draws a graph with number of people(from 1 to 400) on the x axis and probability on the y axis, but doesn't work in JDoodle.
